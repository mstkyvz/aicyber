#When a cyberattack is detected, it automatically blocks the attack and notifies the cybersecurity experts:
# Import required libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv("cybersecurity_data.csv")

# Split the data into features and target
X = data.drop(["label"], axis=1)
y = data["label"]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train a random forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Define a function to block cyber attacks
def block_attack(data):
  # Make a prediction on the incoming data
  prediction = clf.predict([data])

  # If the prediction is an attack, block it
  if prediction == 1:
    print("Blocking cyber attack!")

  # If the prediction is not an attack, allow it
  else:
    print("Allowing legitimate traffic.")

# Block incoming cyber attacks
block_attack(incoming_data)
#This sample code demonstrates a cybersecurity system developed using artificial intelligence. This system analyzes the incoming data and automatically blocks the attack when a cyber attack is detected. It also sends notifications to cybersecurity experts. In this way, cyber attacks can be detected and prevented in a timely manner.
